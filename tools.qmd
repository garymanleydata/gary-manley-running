## Run Analytics Engine

I built this tool to provide professional-grade analysis for runners. It focuses on structure, discipline, and recovery—metrics that standard platforms often overlook.

**Features:**
* **Norwegian Intervals:** Analyze pace and heart rate discipline for structured work.
* **Ghost Battle:** Compare two run files to visualize where you gained or lost time.
* **Recovery Check:** strict verification of heart rate caps.
