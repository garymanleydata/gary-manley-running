Running shouldn't dictate your life, and you shouldn't always be stressing about a plan. I prefer to call them **schedules** or **guidelines**.

Listen to your body. Enjoy running as part of a healthy life.

## The Core Philosophy
A key feature of my training is **running slow**. To go fast, we must first build the engine to go far without stress.

In an ideal world, you will use a chest-strap heart rate monitor, but a wrist-based one or even "running by feel" can work if you are honest with yourself.

### The 180 Formula (MAF)
The basic approach is to perform your cardio at **180 minus your age**.

* **Example:** If you are 40 years old, most of your running should be below **140 beats per minute (bpm)**.
* **The Limit:** 140 bpm is the *maximum*, not the average.

To start with, this can be frustrating. It will likely include walking, especially uphill. I suggest a **Base Phase** where almost all your running is done at this heart rate. It builds a massive aerobic base without the cortisol stress of high-intensity training.

## The 80/20 Rule
Another popular philosophy I use is **80/20 Running**.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
### The Balance
* **80%** of your training should be very easy (like the MAF pace above).
* **20%** of your training is speedwork.

**Why this matters:**
If you run 30 miles a week and run a hard parkrun (3 miles), you have done your 10% speedwork right there. If you do the rest of your runs "kind of hard," you are training in the grey zone—too hard to recover, too easy to get fast.
:::

I favour a conservative approach: start at **100/0** (all easy), then move to **90/10**, and finally **80/20** only when your body is ready.
