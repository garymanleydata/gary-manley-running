    "text": "Norwegian Singles (Double Threshold)\nThis method, popularized by the Ingebrigtsen brothers, has revolutionized endurance training. While elites do this twice a day, we can adapt the principles for normal life.\n\nThe Concept\nInstead of running continuous hard tempos (e.g., 20 mins hard), you break the work into short intervals with very short rest. * The Goal: Keep your lactate levels controlled. You should not be gasping for air. You should feel like you could go faster, but you don’t. * The Magic: You get more volume at “threshold” pace without the fatigue of a continuous run.\n\n\nThe Workout\nTry this “Norwegian” style session: 1. Warm up: 10-15 mins easy. 2. The Work: 10 x 3 minutes at Threshold Pace. * Recovery: Only 60 seconds (standing or walking). * Intensity: 7/10. Comfortably hard. NOT sprint pace. 3. Cool down: 10 mins easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhy it works\n\n\n\nBy taking a 60-second break every 3 minutes, you clear the lactate before it builds up. This allows you to do 30 minutes of quality work, whereas a continuous run might force you to stop after 15 minutes."

    "text": "My Review\nAuthored by Mark Sisson and Brad Kearns, the book presents a comprehensive blueprint for achieving peak performance while embracing the primal principles of ancestral health.\nSisson and Kearns skilfully marry their expertise in endurance training with the ancestral wisdom of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. The result is a holistic approach that prioritizes intuitive training, emphasizing the importance of aerobic development through MAF training and metabolic efficiency over traditionally high-stress, “chronic cardio” routines.\n\nAccessibility & Science\nThe authors provide a wealth of practical advice, backed by scientific research, to guide readers on the journey to becoming fat-adapted athletes.\nOne of the book’s standout features is its accessibility. They break down complex concepts into easily digestible information, making it suitable for both seasoned athletes and those new to the world of endurance sports. The inclusion of real-life success stories adds a motivational layer to the narrative.\n\n\nThe Barefoot Component\nIt is also great to see barefoot shoes and drills being encouraged. We evolved to be barefoot and whilst our feet are too weak from years of cushioning and at risk from modern paths, there is no reason some barefoot walking can’t be used to improve technique and stave off injury.\n\n\nConclusion\n“Primal Endurance” doesn’t just stop at training methodologies; it also explores the importance of nutrition, sleep, and stress management in achieving optimal performance. The emphasis on a holistic lifestyle approach ensures that readers walk away with a comprehensive understanding of how to thrive in all aspects of life."

Add a backpack with a little weight. It increases strength and cardio load. So long as you stay under your desired heart rate, it is awesome training (even better on hills)."

    "text": "Recovery Protocols\n\n1. Massage\nMassage has numerous reported benefits. The odd session with a sports masseuse is a good investment, and for day-to-day use, a massage gun can really help.\nReported Benefits: * Blood Flow: Flushes waste products (like lactate) and delivers oxygen/nutrients for repair. * Flexibility: Breaks up adhesions and releases tight muscles, improving range of motion. * Mental State: Reduces cortisol (stress hormone) and improves sleep quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningImportant Considerations\n\n\n\n\nTiming: Some athletes prefer massage before competition to relax, others after for recovery.\nCaution: A deep sports massage is not advised shortly before an all-out performance (it can leave legs feeling “heavy”).\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Compression\nI have had mixed results myself, but there are many reported benefits for compression clothing. * The Theory: It supports blood flow and reduces muscle oscillation. * The Reality: Even if the physical benefit is marginal, the Expectation Effect (see Mental Training) makes it worth trying. It is unlikely to hinder recovery.\n\n\n3. Breathing\nFor a deep dive, read Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art.\n\nNasal Breathing: Try to adopt nasal breathing during most of the day and even on walks.\nTools: Devices like the AiroFit have limited evidence, but if you can get one second-hand, it can be a useful tool for respiratory strength.\n\n\n\n4. Bio-Hacks\n\nStanding Desks: Essential for flexibility. If you sit for 8 hours, your hip flexors shorten, which ruins your running gait. Stand where you can.\nPower Poses: Based on the TED Talk by Amy Cuddy. Performing “power poses” (standing tall, arms open) can increase testosterone and improve performance. Consider integrating this into your pre-race routine."

Focus on the Positives * Past: Focus on races and training that went well. * Present: In a session, focus on the single rep that felt good. * Future: Focus on what you can control.\n4. Create a Confidence Board Combine your mental cues into a single view. See my example here.\n5. Visualization Using all your senses, imagine yourself achieving your next goal. Be as detailed as possible.\n6. Reframe the Day If you are having a bad day, simply change your mind and decide to have a good day.\n7.

You should use as much detail and as many senses as possible—smells, sights, the feel of your clothes, your thought patterns.\nHere is a script based on my local parkrun winter route:\n\n“I arrive at the event in good time… I feel confident, recovered and have belief that my training will power me through.\nI perform my strides and warm up drills, noticing how my legs and arms feel strong and powerful. My shoes feel springy. I arrive back at the start line and move to the front. I undertake my CBA routine and prepare my convictions: ‘It is my time to shine, I have done the work, today is my day.’\nAs the RD says go, I get up to speed quickly. I am confident and do not let others’ performances deter me. My breathing becomes deep and the breeze starts to cool my skin… I pass through the 1km point onto the long back straight… I can feel my legs are still feeling strong…\nI drive over the bridge, through the underpass and onto the final straight. I kick going past the final bench and bolt through the finishing funnel.\nI have just had the run of my life. I feel elated and exhausted and in disbelief of my time. I smile as I head home to share the news.”"

She demonstrated that simply believing a food was filling made it more filling, and cleaners who were taught that cleaning is good exercise actually became fitter.\nApply this to running: * If you believe caffeine gives you a boost, it will have a larger impact. * If you believe running slow makes you fast, you will likely see faster improvements. * Researching your training methods increases your belief in them, which physically enhances their effectiveness.\n\nRecommended Viewing\n Change your mindset, change the game: Dr. Alia Crum at TEDxTraverseCity\n The Expectation Effect: David Robson at TEDx\n\n\nRecommended Books\n\nThe Confident Mind by Dr. Nate Zinsser\nThe Expectation Effect by David Robson\nBeyond Grit by Cindra Kamphoff"

If you have a choice between an extra hour of sleep or setting an early alarm to squeeze in a run, choose the sleep.\nHere are the key protocols I recommend for maximizing recovery:\n\nMind the Gap: Stop eating at least 3 hours before bed. Digestion interferes with deep sleep.\nTraining Timing: Try to leave a 3-hour gap between exercise and sleep. I know this is difficult with evening running clubs, but do your best to wind down.\nLight Control: Use blue light filters on your devices or wear blue light blocking glasses in the evening.\nEnvironment: Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and comfortable.\nThe “Light Sleeper” Hack: If you wake up easily, try sound blockers. I personally use ear buds playing an audiobook with a calm narrator. It blocks out noise and stops my brain from racing."

    "text": "Integrating Family & Life\nFinding time to train is often the biggest hurdle. The solution is not to ignore your family, but to integrate them into your movement.\nEverything depends on your personal circumstances, but here is how I have made it work:\n\n1. The “Social” Run\nRun with a slower partner, or if you have kids, let them ride a scooter or bike alongside you while you run. You get your training done, and you get quality time together.\n\n\n2. The “Errand” Run\nTurn chores into training. Run to the shops, run the dog, or run to commute. It kills two birds with one stone.\n\n\n3. The “Split” Run\nDon’t be afraid to break a long run into bite-sized chunks.\n\nMy Experience: I have previously replaced a single long run with four mini-runs:\n\n2 miles on the morning school run\n2 miles walking the dog at lunch\n2 miles on the afternoon school run\n3 miles with my wife in the evening\n\nWas a single 9-mile run better physiologically? Probably. But I couldn’t fit a continuous 90 minutes into that day. 9 miles broken up is infinitely better than 0 miles perfectly planned."

Enhanced Proprioception Walking and running barefoot stimulate the sensory receptors in the feet, improving proprioception (awareness of your body’s position in space). This leads to better balance, coordination, and a reduced risk of falls, especially in older adults.\n2. Strengthened Foot Muscles Without the “crutch” of supportive shoes, your foot muscles are forced to work harder to stabilize the foot and absorb impact. This leads to increased strength and improved mechanical function.\n3. Reduced Risk of Injury While counterintuitive, studies suggest that barefoot running may reduce the risk of certain injuries—such as stress fractures and plantar fasciitis—by promoting a more natural gait and reducing high-impact heel strikes."

Proponents believe this can reduce inflammation and improve sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningImportant Considerations\n\n\n\n1. Transition Gradually This is the most critical rule. If you are new to barefoot movement, your calves and Achilles are likely tight and weak. Start with laughably short distances and gradually increase duration over months, not weeks.\n2. Choose Appropriate Surfaces Avoid rough or hazardous surfaces initially. Opt for soft, natural surfaces like grass or sand until your skin and muscles adapt.\n3. Listen to Your Body If you experience pain, stop immediately. Rest is part of the process.\n4. Consult a Professional If you have existing foot concerns, consult a qualified podiatrist (preferably one who understands functional movement) before starting."

To go fast, we must first build the engine to go far without stress.\nIn an ideal world, you will use a chest-strap heart rate monitor, but a wrist-based one or even “running by feel” can work if you are honest with yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe 180 Formula (MAF)\n\n\n\nThe basic approach is to perform your cardio at 180 minus your age.\n\nExample: If you are 40 years old, most of your running should be below 140 beats per minute (bpm).\nThe Limit: 140 bpm is the maximum, not the average.\n\nTo start with, this can be frustrating. It will likely include walking, especially uphill. I suggest a Base Phase where almost all your running is done at this heart rate. It builds a massive aerobic base without the cortisol stress of high-intensity training."

If you do the rest of your runs “kind of hard,” you are training in the grey zone—too hard to recover, too easy to get fast.\n\n\nI favour a conservative approach: start at 100/0 (all easy), then move to 90/10, and finally 80/20 only when your body is ready."

    "text": "The Eating Schedule (Fasting)\n“Diet” is what you eat; “Fasting” is when you eat.\nThis approach takes advantage of the fact that humans naturally fast overnight. Extending this window allows insulin to drop and fat cells to be mobilized. This pairs perfectly with slow running (MAF).\nWork by scientists like Tim Noakes has shown that becoming “fat-adapted” increases the energy you can derive from body fat during intense exercise, significantly reducing the chance of “bonking” (running out of energy).\n\nMy Protocols\n\nThe Morning Window: Don’t eat for 2-3 hours after waking up.\nFasted Training: Do some morning runs before eating anything.\n\nReference: I regularly do parkrun fasted (approx. 21 hours without food).\n\nThe Evening Gap: Do not eat for at least 3 hours before bed.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Adaptation\nIf you take well to fat adaptation, you can push this further. It is routine for me to:\n\nRun 10 miles first thing in the morning.\nNot eat until lunchtime.\nFit in strength training or cross-training later.\nEat only one meal a day (OMAD) or within a 1-hour window.\n\n\nNote: This level of fasting is for metabolically flexible runners. Don’t force it if you feel dizzy or weak."

    "text": "Book: Born to Run by Christopher McDougall\nDifficulty: Easy Jog (Extremely Readable)\nThe Gist: High-octane adventure meets evolutionary biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTL;DR Verdict\n\n\n\nEssential reading. It reframes running from a chore into a biological necessity and a joy. Warning: Do not read this and immediately throw away your shoes; transition slowly.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristopher McDougall was a broken runner. At 6’4” and 230 pounds, every doctor told him the same thing: “The human body isn’t designed for running; stop before you destroy your knees.”\nRefusing to accept that humans are destined to break, he trekked into the deadly Copper Canyons of Mexico to find the Tarahumara (the Rarámuri), a reclusive tribe who run hundreds of miles at a time without injury, without rest, and—most maddeningly of all—with a smile on their faces.\nThis isn’t just a story about a race; it is a forensic investigation into why modern runners get hurt while ancient runners are still logging ultra-marathons in their 80s.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve broken the book down into three non-negotiable pillars.\n\n\nMcDougall argues that the modern Western runner is fueled by stress, calorie-counting, and “no pain, no gain” suffering. The Tarahumara are fueled by korima (a culture of sharing) and pure joy.\n\nThe Lesson: Tension causes inefficiency. If you treat running like a chore or a battle, your muscles tighten, your form breaks, and you get injured. The Tarahumara run loose and laugh because relaxation = endurance.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the scientific backbone of the book. Referencing Harvard biologist Daniel Lieberman, McDougall argues that humans are the ultimate endurance machine. We aren’t fast, but we are the only animal that can shed heat while moving (sweating) and breathe independently of our stride.\nThe Data: We didn’t evolve to run to get away from predators; we evolved to run after prey until they collapsed from heat exhaustion. You were quite literally “born to run.”\n\n\n\nThe most controversial “split” in the book. McDougall wages war on the modern running shoe industry, arguing that cushioned heels encourage a high-impact “heel strike” that sends shockwaves through the joints.\n\nHe suggests that adding cushioning to a shoe is like putting a cast on a healthy limb—it causes the foot muscles to atrophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to move to the Copper Canyons to run like a Tarahumara. Here is how to apply the book to your training tomorrow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote🏃 Practical Application\n\n\n\n\nThe “Easy, Light, Smooth” Mantra Caballo Blanco (the book’s mysterious coach figure) offers the ultimate form cue. Do not try to be fast.\n\nFirst, focus on being Easy (relaxed).\nNext, focus on being Light (quiet feet).\nThen, focus on being Smooth.\nFast happens on its own as a result of the first three.\n\nCadence is King McDougall emphasizes a quick turnover (~180 steps per minute). This prevents over-striding (landing with your foot too far in front of you), which is the primary cause of knee, hip, and shin injuries.\nFuel Like a Minimalist The characters survive on Pinole (toasted corn flour) and Chia seeds (the “runner’s caviar”). The lesson is to focus on whole, simple foods rather than processed gels that spike and crash your blood sugar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it a PR or a DNF?\nVerdict: PR (Personal Record)\nThis book launched the “barefoot running” craze of 2010. While that led to some injuries for the unprepared, the core message remains untouched. Read it for the spirit. It successfully reframes running from a “punishment for eating pizza” into a celebration of human history. If you take nothing else away from this book take away that humans have evolved to move and the closer to we stick the our origins the better things are likely to work out in the long run.\nFinal Score: ⭐⭐⭐⭐"

    "text": "Book: Run Elite by Andrew Snow Difficulty: Moderate (An attempt to cover everything) The Gist: A book that aims to be a comprehensive manual covering training, mindset, and nutrition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionTL;DR Verdict\n\n\n\nScore: 6/10 (Would be higher without the nutrition section). It tries to be a “Jack of all trades” but ends up being a master of none. It offers a great introduction to various concepts, but if you want deep expertise, you might be left hungry.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is notoriously hard to review general training books because they walk a fine line between “too simple” and “too complex.” Andrew Snow attempts to bridge the gap by offering a holistic system.\nThe book shines brightest in its opening chapters. Snow dives deep into the psychology of performance, referencing the approaches of legends like Emil Zátopek, Roger Bannister, Eliud Kipchoge, Steve Prefontaine, and Usain Bolt. It sets a strong stage, suggesting that before you train the legs, you must train the governor in the brain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where the book delivers real value. The sections on mental resilience are actionable and engaging. * It serves as a solid gateway drug to dedicated mental training. * Reviewer Note: If this section hooks you, you are better off graduating immediately to specialized texts like The Confident Mind or Beyond Grit for the deep dive.\n\n\n\nSnow advocates for a specific type of speed work that many endurance runners neglect: Alactic Hill Sprints. * The logic is to recruit maximum muscle fibers without flooding the legs with lactate. It’s about neural drive, not metabolic conditioning.\n\n\n\nThis is where the book loses momentum. The nutritional advice feels less rigorous than the training philosophy. * Critique: The nutrition section feels like “junk miles.” It distracts from the core message. If you want evidence-based nutrition or metabolic efficiency, you are better off waiting for the new Lore of Running or looking up Tim Noakes’ recent work.\n\n\n\nWhile the book covers base training, speed work, and tapering, the actual plans lack the specificity and inspiration found in the gold standards. * Alternative: If you want a plan that is battle-tested, go to Jack Daniels (for precision) or Pfitzinger’s Advanced Marathoning (for volume).\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the critiques, there are three diamonds in the rough that I have incorporated into my own training:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote🏃 Practical Application\n\n\n\n\nTaper Less Snow argues that many amateur runners treat the taper like a vacation. They shut down too early, losing muscle tension and “pop.” The takeaway: Keep the intensity high, just drop the volume. Don’t let your engine go cold.\nWork More on Mindset Physical fitness is often capped by mental fragility. Snow reinforces that you need to intentionally train your ability to suffer and stay calm, just like you train your VO2 Max.\nThe 8-Second Hill Rep This is a specific, actionable workout.\n\nThe Drill: Run up a steep hill at max effort for only 8 seconds.\nThe Recovery: Full recovery (wait until you are breathing normally).\nThe Why: This builds explosive power and running economy without the fatigue of a 400m repeat. It creates a “springier” runner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it a PR or a DNF?\nVerdict: A Solid Tempo Run (But not a Race Winner)\nRun Elite is well worth a read—especially if you can find it second-hand. It offers some unique training advice (like the hill reps) that you won’t hear elsewhere. However, it suffers from trying to do too much. It offers an appetizer for every aspect of running but doesn’t quite serve the main course.\nFinal Recommendations: * For Mindset: Switch to The Confident Mind. * For Plans: Switch to Faster Road Racing (Pfitzinger). * For Nutrition: Switch to Tim Noakes. * For Run Elite: Read the first half, steal the hill sprints, and skim the rest."
