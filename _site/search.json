    "text": "The Core Philosophy\nA key feature of my training is running slow. To go fast, we must first build the engine to go far without stress.\nIn an ideal world, you will use a chest-strap heart rate monitor, but a wrist-based one or even “running by feel” can work if you are honest with yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe 180 Formula (MAF)\n\n\n\nThe basic approach is to perform your cardio at 180 minus your age.\n\nExample: If you are 40 years old, most of your running should be below 140 beats per minute (bpm).\nThe Limit: 140 bpm is the maximum, not the average.\n\nTo start with, this can be frustrating. It will likely include walking, especially uphill. I suggest a Base Phase where almost all your running is done at this heart rate. It builds a massive aerobic base without the cortisol stress of high-intensity training."

    "text": "The 80/20 Rule\nAnother popular philosophy I use is 80/20 Running.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipThe Balance\n\n\n\n\n80% of your training should be very easy (like the MAF pace above).\n20% of your training is speedwork.\n\nWhy this matters: If you run 30 miles a week and run a hard parkrun (3 miles), you have done your 10% speedwork right there. If you do the rest of your runs “kind of hard,” you are training in the grey zone—too hard to recover, too easy to get fast.\n\n\nI favour a conservative approach: start at 100/0 (all easy), then move to 90/10, and finally 80/20 only when your body is ready."

If you have a choice between an extra hour of sleep or setting an early alarm to squeeze in a run, choose the sleep.\nHere are the key protocols I recommend for maximizing recovery:\n\nMind the Gap: Stop eating at least 3 hours before bed. Digestion interferes with deep sleep.\nTraining Timing: Try to leave a 3-hour gap between exercise and sleep. I know this is difficult with evening running clubs, but do your best to wind down.\nLight Control: Use blue light filters on your devices or wear blue light blocking glasses in the evening.\nEnvironment: Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and comfortable.\nThe “Light Sleeper” Hack: If you wake up easily, try sound blockers. I personally use ear buds playing an audiobook with a calm narrator. It blocks out noise and stops my brain from racing."

The solution is not to ignore your family, but to integrate them into your movement.\nEverything depends on your personal circumstances, but here is how I have made it work:\n\n1. The “Social” Run\nRun with a slower partner, or if you have kids, let them ride a scooter or bike alongside you while you run. You get your training done, and you get quality time together.\n\n\n2. The “Errand” Run\nTurn chores into training. Run to the shops, run the dog, or run to commute. It kills two birds with one stone.\n\n\n3. The “Split” Run\nDon’t be afraid to break a long run into bite-sized chunks.\n\nMy Experience: I have previously replaced a single long run with four mini-runs:\n\n2 miles on the morning school run\n2 miles walking the dog at lunch\n2 miles on the afternoon school run\n3 miles with my wife in the evening\n\nWas a single 9-mile run better physiologically? Probably. But I couldn’t fit a continuous 90 minutes into that day. 9 miles broken up is infinitely better than 0 miles perfectly planned."

The Training\nHumans are complex systems. Running performance is not just about miles; it is about health. * Holistic Guidance: I provide advice on strength training, mental resilience, technique, and nutrition (including low-carb/keto adaptations if that is your goal). * Regular Feedback: We stay in touch regularly.

    "text": "The Eating Schedule (Fasting)\n“Diet” is what you eat; “Fasting” is when you eat.\nThis approach takes advantage of the fact that humans naturally fast overnight. Extending this window allows insulin to drop and fat cells to be mobilized. This pairs perfectly with slow running (MAF).\nWork by scientists like Tim Noakes has shown that becoming “fat-adapted” increases the energy you can derive from body fat during intense exercise, significantly reducing the chance of “bonking” (running out of energy).\n\nMy Protocols\n\nThe Morning Window: Don’t eat for 2-3 hours after waking up.\nFasted Training: Do some morning runs before eating anything.\n\nReference: I regularly do parkrun fasted (approx. 21 hours without food).\n\nThe Evening Gap: Do not eat for at least 3 hours before bed.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Adaptation\nIf you take well to fat adaptation, you can push this further. It is routine for me to:\n\nRun 10 miles first thing in the morning.\nNot eat until lunchtime.\nFit in strength training or cross-training later.\nEat only one meal a day (OMAD) or within a 1-hour window.\n\n\nNote: This level of fasting is for metabolically flexible runners. Don’t force it if you feel dizzy or weak."
