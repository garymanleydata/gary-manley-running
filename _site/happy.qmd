## The Joy of Movement

Running should be a source of stress relief, not a source of stress. If your training schedule makes you anxious, it is the wrong schedule.

### 1. Mood & Mindset
We run to clear our heads. The neurochemical benefits of aerobic exercise are well documented, but they only work if we enjoy the process. My coaching prioritizes enjoyment because a happy runner is a consistent runner.

### 2. Consistency Over Intensity
It is better to run 30 minutes every day with a smile than to run 2 hours once a week in pain. By managing intensity (using the MAF method), we keep cortisol low and enjoyment high.

### 3. Life Integration
Your training must fit your life. We build schedules around your work and family commitments, ensuring that running enhances your daily routine rather than dominating it.
