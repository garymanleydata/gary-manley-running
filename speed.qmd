title: "Speed Work"
---

Speed work is not just for elite athletes. It improves efficiency and makes your "easy" pace feel even easier.

However, we do not train until we vomit. We train to stimulate, not annihilate.

## The Classics
* **Strides:** 4-6 x 20 second accelerations at the end of an easy run.
* **Hill Sprints:** Short, max effort bursts up a steep hill (great for power, low impact risk).

## Norwegian Singles (Double Threshold)
This method, popularized by the Ingebrigtsen brothers, has revolutionized endurance training. While elites do this twice a day, we can adapt the principles for normal life.

### The Concept
Instead of running continuous hard tempos (e.g., 20 mins hard), you break the work into short intervals with very short rest.
* **The Goal:** Keep your lactate levels **controlled**. You should not be gasping for air. You should feel like you could go faster, but you don't.
* **The Magic:** You get more volume at "threshold" pace without the fatigue of a continuous run.

### The Workout
Try this "Norwegian" style session:
1.  **Warm up:** 10-15 mins easy.
2.  **The Work:** 10 x 3 minutes at Threshold Pace.
    * *Recovery:* Only 60 seconds (standing or walking).
    * *Intensity:* 7/10. Comfortably hard. NOT sprint pace.
3.  **Cool down:** 10 mins easy.

::: {.callout-tip title="Why it works"}
By taking a 60-second break every 3 minutes, you clear the lactate before it builds up. This allows you to do **30 minutes** of quality work, whereas a continuous run might force you to stop after 15 minutes.
