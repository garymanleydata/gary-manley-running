title: "Strength Training"

Strength training is non-negotiable for runners. It boosts economy, increases fatigue resistance, and keeps you injury-free.

## The Routine
You don't need a gym membership. A simple bodyweight routine performed consistently is better than a complex heavy-lifting routine performed sporadically.

## Upper Body & Core
Running is a full-body movement. Your arms drive your legs.

* **Push Ups:** Strengthens core and chest for driving power.
* **Plank / Side Plank:** Promotes core stability to hold form when tired.
* **Bent Over Row:** Strengthens back for postural endurance on long runs.

> **Guideline:** Aim for 2 sessions per week. Keep it simple, keep it consistent.
