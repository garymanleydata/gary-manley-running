title: "Other Methods & Resources"

A collection of training methods, recovery protocols, and resources that are essential to the holistic runner.

## Cross Training

When I say cross training, I am referring to everything from walking and rucking to the elliptical, swimming, and cycling. 

See [Mental Training](mental.qmd) to fully appreciate how much this kind of training can help you.

**Key Benefits:**
* **Cardio & Recovery:** If you are finding the running volume too high but want to improve, cross training increases aerobic load while reducing impact.
* **Active Recovery:** There is a growing body of evidence showing that a gentle walk is more beneficial for recovery than sitting on the sofa.
* **The "Ruck" Hack:** Going for a recovery walk? Add a backpack with a little weight. It increases strength and cardio load. So long as you stay under your desired heart rate, it is awesome training (even better on hills).

## Recovery Protocols

### 1. Massage
Massage has numerous reported benefits. The odd session with a sports masseuse is a good investment, and for day-to-day use, a massage gun can really help.

**Reported Benefits:**
* **Blood Flow:** Flushes waste products (like lactate) and delivers oxygen/nutrients for repair.
* **Flexibility:** Breaks up adhesions and releases tight muscles, improving range of motion.
* **Mental State:** Reduces cortisol (stress hormone) and improves sleep quality.

### Important Considerations
* **Timing:** Some athletes prefer massage *before* competition to relax, others *after* for recovery.
* **Caution:** A deep sports massage is **not** advised shortly before an all-out performance (it can leave legs feeling "heavy").

### 2. Compression
I have had mixed results myself, but there are many reported benefits for compression clothing. 
* **The Theory:** It supports blood flow and reduces muscle oscillation.
* **The Reality:** Even if the physical benefit is marginal, the **Expectation Effect** (see Mental Training) makes it worth trying. It is unlikely to hinder recovery.

### 3. Breathing
For a deep dive, read *Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art*.

* **Nasal Breathing:** Try to adopt nasal breathing during most of the day and even on walks.
* **Tools:** Devices like the **AiroFit** have limited evidence, but if you can get one second-hand, it can be a useful tool for respiratory strength.

### 4. Bio-Hacks
* **Standing Desks:** Essential for flexibility. If you sit for 8 hours, your hip flexors shorten, which ruins your running gait. Stand where you can.
* **Power Poses:** Based on the TED Talk by **Amy Cuddy**. Performing "power poses" (standing tall, arms open) can increase testosterone and improve performance. Consider integrating this into your pre-race routine.

## My Library

I am constantly reading and researching. If you only read three books this year, make it these:

1.  **The Big Book of Endurance Training** - Phil Maffetone
2.  **Born to Run** - Christopher McDougall
3.  **Why We Sleep** - Matthew Walker
