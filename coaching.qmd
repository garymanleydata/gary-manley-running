title: "Personal Coaching"
---

I believe that everyone is unique. You deserve a dynamic training guide, not a rigid spreadsheet.

## My Philosophy
Most training plans fail because life gets in the way. A static PDF cannot adjust when you get sick, work gets stressful, or you just feel tired.

**I work differently.** I limit myself to a small number of runners at a time so I can provide true personalization. We will build a **flexible training guide** together. We remain dynamic—adjusting the structure as your life changes—so you can focus on the running while I focus on the planning.

### Who I Coach
Whether your goal is getting off the couch, smashing a parkrun PB, or completing your first Half Marathon, I can help.

> **Important Note:** I put your health first. I do not coach for distances longer than a Half Marathon (21km), as I believe the training volume required for ultra-endurance events is often contrary to long-term health.

## How It Works

### 1. The Onboarding
Before we run a single mile, we need to ensure we are a good match.
* **The Portfolio:** You will complete a "Getting to Know You" portfolio covering your history, injuries, and wildest goals.
* **The Consultation:** We will have a virtual or face-to-face meeting to dig into the details.
* **The Strategy:** We align your target races with a realistic roadmap.

### 2. The Training
Humans are complex systems. Running performance is not just about miles; it is about health.
* **Holistic Guidance:** I provide advice on strength training, mental resilience, technique, and nutrition (including low-carb/keto adaptations if that is your goal).
* **Regular Feedback:** We stay in touch regularly. You share how you feel; I adjust the guide.
