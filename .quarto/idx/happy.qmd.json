Running should be a source of happiness, not stress. My golden rule is simple: **Fit running around your life, do not fit your life around your running.**\n\nMost people struggle to sustain habits that require constant discipline. Think about how hard it is to force yourself to lose weight or run in conditions you hate. If you rely on willpower alone, you will eventually burn out.\n\nInstead, we focus on enjoyment. Prioritize your sleep, your recovery, and your family (well, assuming you enjoy your family!). When you enjoy the process, consistency happens automatically.\n\n---\n\n## Prioritise Sleep\n\nSleep is the single most effective performance enhancer available. If you have a choice between an extra hour of sleep or setting an early alarm to squeeze in a run, **choose the sleep.**\n\nHere are the key protocols I recommend for maximizing recovery:\n\n* **Mind the Gap:** Stop eating at least **3 hours** before bed. Digestion interferes with deep sleep.\n* **Training Timing:** Try to leave a **3-hour gap** between exercise and sleep. I know this is difficult with evening running clubs, but do your best to wind down.\n* **Light Control:** Use blue light filters on your devices or wear blue light blocking glasses in the evening.\n* **Environment:** Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and comfortable.\n* **The \"Light Sleeper\" Hack:** If you wake up easily, try sound blockers. I personally use ear buds playing an audiobook with a calm narrator. It blocks out noise and stops my brain from racing.\n\n---\n\n## Integrating Family & Life\n\nFinding time to train is often the biggest hurdle. The solution is not to ignore your family, but to integrate them into your movement.\n\nEverything depends on your personal circumstances, but here is how I have made it work:\n\n### 1. The \"Social\" Run\nRun with a slower partner, or if you have kids, let them ride a scooter or bike alongside you while you run. You get your training done, and you get quality time together.\n\n### 2. The \"Errand\" Run\nTurn chores into training. Run to the shops, run the dog, or run to commute. It kills two birds with one stone.\n\n### 3.
