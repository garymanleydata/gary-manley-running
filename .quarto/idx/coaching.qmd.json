You deserve a dynamic training guide, not a rigid spreadsheet.\n\nMost training plans fail because life gets in the way. A static PDF cannot adjust when you get sick, work gets stressful, or you just feel tired.\n\n**I work differently.** I limit myself to a small number of runners at a time so I can provide true personalization. We will build a **flexible training guide** together. We remain dynamic—adjusting the structure as your life changes—so you can focus on the running while I focus on the planning.\n\n### Who I Coach\nWhether your goal is getting off the couch, smashing a parkrun PB, or completing your first Half Marathon, I can help.\n\n> **Important Note:** I put your health first. I do not coach for distances longer than a Half Marathon (21km), as I believe the training volume required for ultra-endurance events is often contrary to long-term health.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n### 1. The Onboarding\nBefore we run a single mile, we need to ensure we are a good match.\n* **The Portfolio:** You will complete a \"Getting to Know You\" portfolio covering your history, injuries, and wildest goals.\n* **The Consultation:** We will have a virtual or face-to-face meeting to dig into the details.\n* **The Strategy:** We align your target races with a realistic roadmap.\n\n### 2. The Training\nHumans are complex systems. Running performance is not just about miles; it is about health.\n* **Holistic Guidance:** I provide advice on strength training, mental resilience, technique, and nutrition (including low-carb/keto adaptations if that is your goal).\n* **Regular Feedback:** We stay in touch regularly. You share how you feel; I adjust the guide.\n\n---\n\n## What Is Included\n\nWhen you sign up, you get a fully comprehensive package:\n\n* **Initial Consultation:** Deep dive into fitness, aspirations, and lifestyle constraints.\n* **Health Audit:** Review of injury history and relevant health markers.\n* **Personalized Guide:** A dynamic training structure built for *you*.\n* **Feedback Loop:** Regular support via email and scheduled calls.\n* **Resource Library:** Access to my advice on nutrition, mental performance, and strength conditioning.\n\n---\n\n## Investment\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n### Setup & Onboarding\n**£50 (One-off)**\nIncludes initial portfolio analysis, health history review, and strategy consultation.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n### Monthly Coaching\n**£45 / month**\nIncludes dynamic planning, regular feedback, and ongoing support.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"minimal\"}\n### 1-on-1 Sessions\n**£50 / hour**\nOptional face-to-face coaching for technique analysis or in-person support.\n:::\n\n[Get in Touch to Start](mailto:gary@garymanleyrunning.com){.btn .btn-primary}","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI believe that everyone is unique.
