> **Coach's Notes:** Fantastic work yesterday, you absolutely crushed it across the board! Your dedication to recovery and training is evident in those near-perfect scores, setting a powerful foundation for continued progress. Keep this incredible momentum going!

## Notes

Today I ran my first Norwegian single session, it went well but will be interesting to see how tired I feel tomorrow. The rest of the day was ok with lots of recovery walking and prehab. Worked a lot on visualisation and hoping that helps me in lots of different ways.
