> **Coach's Notes:** Fantastic work today! Your dedication to prehab and visualization is outstanding, and those cardio scores show real effort. Keep that consistent focus across the board, and you'll continue to build on this excellent foundation.

## Notes

Todays recovery session went well, I took things easy and felt good. I did have some IBS issues and a stressful day otherwise led to lower scores than I would otherwise have been able to get.
