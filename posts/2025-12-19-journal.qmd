> **Coach's Notes:** Fantastic work on your cardio today, hitting perfect scores across the board; keep that intensity up! While your prehab, strength, and mental training were excellent, focus on pushing your sleep score higher to maximize your recovery and unlock even greater performance gains.

## Notes

Lots going on today, some hangover from yesterday impacted my sleep. Overall for a recovery day it was great.
