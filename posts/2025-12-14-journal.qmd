## Daily Snapshot

![](../assets/images/2025-12-14_radar.png)

> **Coach's Notes:** Exceptional performance today across the board! Your perfect scores in sleep, cardio, prehab, eating window, and mental training are exactly what we're aiming for, and the slight dips in cardio 2, cardio 3, strength training, and visualisation show you're pushing boundaries while still maintaining incredible consistency. Keep this intensity and focus, and we'll continue to crush our goals.

## Notes

*Today was rest day with lots of walking and that was actually the best sleep I have had in month, sleeping before 10pm and didn't wake until 5:30! Which is super late for me*
