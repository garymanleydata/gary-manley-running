> **Coach's Notes:** Excellent work on your cardio and nutrition today, crushing those 10s! Your prehab, mental training, and visualization are also strong; keep building on that momentum. However, we need to address your strength training score of 5; let's make sure we're giving that the focus it deserves in our next session.

## Notes

As the notes say I need to start working on getting the strength training in. 

My second NS session felt great and the pace was better than Monday. My legs are feeling fresh and hopefully this continues. 

Excited to see what the next year can bring, aim to stick to this consistently.
